# license-plate-detection-yolo
Project Title: License Plate Detection UI with YOLO. This project showcases an implementation of License Plate Detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning framework. The objective is to accurately and efficiently detect license plates within images or video streams, a critical component in various applications such as traffic management, surveillance, and automated toll collection.



Key Features:

Seamlessly integrates YOLO-based license plate detection with an intuitive user interface.
Enables users to upload images or access real-time video streams for license plate detection.
Offers a responsive and visually appealing dashboard for viewing detected license plates.
Provides options for customizing detection parameters and visualizing results.
Supports both single-image processing and real-time video stream analysis.
Offers flexibility for integration into existing projects or systems.
Contains example datasets and annotation tools for custom training if needed.
How to Use:
